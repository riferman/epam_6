Make a long_long_function() function accept a filename, and store last 10 lines (or less) in another file named “truncated_%filename%”.
For example, last 10 lines (or less) from file “lorem_ipsum.txt” must be copied into new “truncated_lorem_ipsum.txt”
You can generate the files content here: https://www.lipsum.com/ or get anywhere you like, it does not matter.
